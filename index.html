                <h2> Football <span>Information</span></h2>
                <p>Football, also called association football or soccer, is a game involving two
                    teams of 11 players who
                    try to maneuver the ball into the other team's goal without using their hands or arms. The team that
                    scores more goals wins. Football is the world's most popular ball game in numbers of participants
                    and spectators.</p>

                <h2> <span>Football</span> Information</h2>
                <p> Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of
                    participants and
                    spectators. Simple in its principal rules and essential equipment, the sport can be played almost
                    anywhere, from official football playing fields (pitches) to gymnasiums, streets, school
                    playgrounds, parks, or beaches. Football’s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Football
                    Association (FIFA), estimated that at the turn of the 21st century there were approximately 250
                    million football players and over 1.3 billion people “interested” in football; in 2010 a combined
                    television audience of more than 26 billion watched football’s premier tournament, the quadrennial
                    month-long World Cup finals. </p>
